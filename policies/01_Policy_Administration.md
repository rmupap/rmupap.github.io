## Background and Purpose

The University of Charleston Physician Assistant Program (UCPAP) is committed to providing clear expectations and therefore has developed the policy statement below. The purpose of the policy is to explain the manner in which policies are developed, approved, and reviewed. It also describes procedures for disseminating program policy and practice information to students.

## Policy Statement

### General Policy Information

Program policies apply to all students, principal faculty, and the program director regardless of location except in circumstances where certain discrepancies may exist between program policies and those established at preceptorship locations. The UCPAP will train and assess students on HIPAA, blood borne pathogens and universal precautions. However, when discrepancies exist relative to these three areas, those at preceptorship locations will supersede those of the program.

### Procedures for Policy Development, Approval, and Review

New policies may be drafted by, or under the direction of, the Program Director. The initial draft should be reviewed, modified, and approved via the program committee that is expected to take ownership for cyclical review of the policy.

Once approved at the designated committee level, the policy will be evaluated by the program faculty, which serves as lead governing body. The program faculty may approve the policy as drafted, approve the policy pending specific changes that have been agreed upon, or send the policy back to the committee for further development and/or modification.

Approved policies will be reviewed according to the frequency described in each policy and as necessary in accordance with the program self-assessment process.

### Procedures for Informing Students of Policies and Practices

In an effort to help those interested make a fully informed decision about applying to and matriculating into the UC PA Program, and in an effort to make applicable information about the program easily accessible for current students, faculty, alumni and other stakeholders, links to several RMUoHP-PAP policies will be made available via the official program website at [rmupap.github.io/policies](http://rmupap.github.io/policies).

Within the online UCPAP application portal, prior to completing initial registration for an online application account, links will be made available to web materials including applicable policies that provide the information contained in the list below. In order to continue with the application process, applicants will be required to check a box signifying acknowledgment that this information has been made available to them.

* ARC-PA accreditation status
* Success of the program in achieving its goals (beginning in 2016)
* PANCE rates for five most recent graduating classes (beginning in 2016)
* All required curricular components
* Academic credit offered by the program
* Estimates of all costs related to the program
* Policies and procedures for refunds of tuition and fees
* Policies about student employment while enrolled in the program
* Admission and enrollment practices that favor specified individuals or groups
* Admission requirements regarding prior education or work experience
* Policies and procedures concerning awarding or granting advanced placement
* Any required academic standards for enrollment
* Any required technical standards for enrollment
* Completion deadlines/requirements related to curricular components

* Policies and procedures for processing student grievances

* Policies and procedures for remediation and deceleration
* Policies and procedures for processing allegations of harassment

### Statement of Agreement to Abide by Program Policies and Practices

During the new student orientation process, all policies and practices that pertain to enrolled students will be reviewed and students will have full opportunity to ask any questions they may have.

Students will be required to sign a statement that program policies and practices have been reviewed, that they understand and agree to abide by program policies and practices, and that they have had a full opportunity to have any related questions addressed satisfactorily.

### Policies Pertaining to Prospective and Currently Enrolled Students

The following links will be made available publicly to inform prospective and enrolled students of program policies and practices that pertain to them.

* Policy Administration
* Academic Performance and Progression
* Admissions
* Program Costs
* Social Media
* Technology
* Dress Standard
* Safety and Infection Control
* Student Advising
* Student Assessment
* Student Attendance, Participation, and Inclement Weather
* Student Employment
* Student Health
* Student Role in Classroom and SCPEs
* SCPE Patient Exposure
* Supervised Clinical Practice

The Program Faculty reserve the right to change existing or create new policies and apply these changes or new policies to currently enrolled students.

When any of the policies above are changed a notation of the modification date will be included on the web and enrolled students will be notified of the change within 10 business days. For any policy modifications resulting in academic progression or graduation requirement changes, enrolled students will be required to sign a statement of understanding of the changes.

### Policy Changes

**Definitions:**

* **Minor:** Any change that does not require a team faculty decision.
* **Moderate:** Any change that warrants faculty vote and policy version change.
* **Substantive:** Significant change to the operations of the program including modifications of the program’s mission, vision, or goals, revision of graduation requirements, or policy and/or procedural changes made in response to federal or state laws or regulations.

All substantive changes must be reviewed and approved by the Provost prior to implementation. Changes in response to federal or state laws or regulations must also be reviewed by legal to assure compliance.

### Archiving Policies

Prior to making any moderate or substantive changes to any UCPAP policies, a pdf file will be created and loaded into the policy’s web page. A note should be included on the revised policy that briefly explains why the modification was necessary. The date of the occurrence should also be included and a new version number assigned.

**Rationale:** 

1. Serves as one method to demonstrate results of critical analysis from ongoing self-assessment and 
2. Archived policies may be referenced as necessary when questions arise associated with students who entered the program under a separate policy.
