What you see below is an embedded editable real-time collaboration wiki called Hackpad. **Yes, [Hackpad][hackpad] is awesome!**[^hackpadnote] 

With the hackpad below, you can quickly see our plans for additional website content. You also have the opportunity to jot down a suggestion of your own!... if you like. Just scroll to the bottom of the hackpad and start typing under the '<span class="highlight">SUGGESTIONS</span>' heading.[^roadmap]<br/>

[^roadmap]: please read through the entirety of our website before making a suggestion; also, no questions here please... they belong on the [information web group page](http://rmupap.github.io/admissions/rmuohp-pap-information-group/)
[^hackpadnote]: we had to give these guys a plug... this technology is quite impressive and will only get better; by the way, Hackpad is one example of several game-changing technologies we will use to educate students in our program!
