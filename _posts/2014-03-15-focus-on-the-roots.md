## Two Typical Approaches to Learning Medicine

1. Content-centered
2. Principle-centered 
 
**Knowing the difference is critical!** 

A content-centered approach may allow one to pass his courses. He may even pass the boards, get licensed, find a job, and function just well enough to perform at a basic level and stay employed. However, there will be significant repercussions:

<p class="message">
1. He will not find much satisfaction in his career.<br/>  
2. His understanding of medicine will be limited.<br/>  
3. He will consistently find himself frustrated.<br/>  
4. He will not have the capability to develop into an outstanding clinician.  </p>
 
A principle-centered approach, on the other hand, will provide the foundation one needs to enjoy a remarkable career. A career where one consistently feels stimulated, where he can challenge himself to develop further and further. Consequently, he stands as a tall, full, flourishing oak of knowledge and ability.

## What's the Difference?

A student who is _**content-centered** focuses on the individual leaves of the tree_ whereas the student who is _**principle-centered** focuses on the roots_.

When learning about coronary artery disease, the content-centered student pulls out the list of typical symptoms and management options and tries to memorize. The principle-centered student, on the other hand, seeks deeper understanding of involved pathophysiology and fundamental pharmacology _in the effort to make sense out of why_ those symptoms occur, and _why_ we choose certain treatments over others.

When learning about physical examination, the content-centered student learns technique, because this empowers her just well enough to be checked off the list during her practical exams. The principle-centered student wonders why technique became technique. She reflects, “_Why_ do I need to use a bracing finger when using an otoscope?” or “_Why_ is it important to listen to the apex of the heart with the bell of the stethoscope while the patient is in the left lateral decubitus position?” **Not only does she ask, she seeks out the answer**, even though she knows the upcoming practical exam is designed to merely assess whether she performs correct technique.

## Major Advantages of the Principle-Centered Approach

There are two major advantages to the principle-centered approach: 

1. **When one makes sense out of the material, one better retains the information.**
2. **When one strives to understand principles, one discovers connections everywhere!** 

Oftentimes the principles underlying one disease process or treatment approach also apply to several others. In other words, <span class="highlight">focusing on the roots allows one's knowledge base to be connected to every leaf of the tree, whereas focusing on the individual leaves supplies no such connection</span>. **The student who sought to understand principles during her physical examination course... is primed to absorb more content once she begins her study of cardiology.**

Always ask, “_Why?_” 

_Attach meaning_ to everything you learn. 

To the extent possible, master as much physiology, pathophysiology, anatomy, basic pharmacology, and laboratory medicine as possible. **These are the roots. Nourish them. Before you know it, you will be enjoying the fruits of your labors.**
