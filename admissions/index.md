  <strong>Welcome</strong> to the admissions section of Rocky Mountain University of Health Profession's developing physician assistant program (RMUoHP-PAP)!
</p>

<span class="highlight">What an exciting time to pursue your dream of becoming a physician assistant (PA)! We need you now, more than ever!</span>

PAs are in high demand--and rightfully so.  <span class="highlight">They provide a great breadth and depth of high quality health care services</span>. **We need the best available to join the profession and serve as exemplars in filling one of society’s greatest needs**. The elderly population will double in the United States over the next 10-15 years.  Add to this the data showing that this same population consumes the greatest percentage of healthcare resources, and you can understand the daunting challenge ahead.

As a <span class="highlight">well-educated and highly skilled physician assistant, you will enjoy a rewarding career of service to those in need</span>. Service not only for those surpassing the 65-year mark, but as more energy is expended by the entire industry on the aging population, PAs will be in high demand in all areas of medicine.
