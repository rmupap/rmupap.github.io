## Application Screening

Admission to the Rocky Mountain University of Health Professions (RMUoHP) Physician Assistant (PA) program is highly competitive. Individuals who submit applications meeting the minimum qualifications as described on the [Application Requirements](/admissions/application-requirements) and [Prerequisite Courses](/admissions/prerequisite-courses) pages will have their applications scored on a 100-point scale. 

An individual's application is screened only once—after all application materials have been verified by CASPA (including GRE scores). No additional materials pertaining to screening will be considered after this point for the application cycle. For example, if GPA requirements are not met at the time of application screening, GPA scores will not be recalculated to determine if an applicant qualifies for scoring in the event additional coursework is completed. Therefore, make sure your application fully qualifies at the time you submit it via CASPA.

## Application Scoring

Program Admissions Committee (PAC) members consider multiple factors in the scoring process including: 

- perceived ability to successfully complete the RMUoHP PA Program,
- demonstrated communication and interpersonal skills, 
- emotional maturity and life experiences, 
- awareness of physician assistant roles and responsibilities, and 
- suitability for actively engaging in a collaborative environment as a self-motivated learner in accordance with the program's [core values](/core-values) and [mission, vision, and goals](/mission-vision-goals).
