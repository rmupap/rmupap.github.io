## Technical Standards Attestation

All students accepting seats in the Rocky Mountain University of Health Professions (RMUoHP) PA program are required to sign a statement attesting to their ability to meet the program's minimum [technical standards](/technical-standards). These technical standards are necessary for students to achieve the knowledge, skills, and competencies required of an entry-level PA. The Technical Standards Attestation Form can be viewed and downloaded at [pa.rmuohp.link/TechnicalStandardsForm](http://pa.rmuohp.link/TechnicalStandardsForm).

## Immunization History Documentation

RMUoHP PA Program Policy requires all prematriculants provide proof that the following immunizations have been obtained and/or serologic testing results demonstrating proof of immunity:

* **Hepatitis B:** Must provide quantitative hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAB) test results to validate immune status or proof of non-converter status following administration of two separate series.[^hepBnonconverter]
* **Measles (Rubeola):** Records of titer validating current immunity and/or 2-dose vaccine series being administered according to [CDC scheduling guidelines][cdcschedule].
* **Mumps:** Records of titer validating current immunity and/or 2-dose vaccine series being administered according to [CDC scheduling guidelines][cdcschedule].
* **Rubella:** Records of titer validating current immunity and/or 1-dose MMR immunization.
* **Varicella:** Records of titer validating current immunity and/or 2-dose vaccine series being administered according to [CDC scheduling guidelines][cdcschedule].[^varicella]
* **Tetanus/Diphtheria/Pertussis:** Record of having received 1 dose Tdap.
* **Meningococcal Disease:** Record of having received one vaccination.[^mening]
* **Influenza:** Record of having received viral influenza covering the winter season preceding matriculation.[^flu] 

These immunization requirements are based on RMUoHP PA Program policy and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [Recommended Vaccines for Healthcare Workers][cdcschedule]. The Immunization Documentation Form can be viewed and downloaded at [pa.rmuohp.link/ImmunizationDocumentationForm](http://pa.rmuohp.link/ImmunizationDocumentationForm).

## Tuberculosis Screening Documentation

In accordance with CDC guidelines, documentation of tuberculosis (TB) screening is required within one year of matriculation. Repeat screening during the month prior to onset of the first set of supervised clinical practice experiences (SCPEs) and second set of SCPEs will also be required. 

Acceptable testing methods include tuberculin skin testing (TST) for purified protein derivative (PPD) or QuantiFERON®-TB GOLD In-Tube Test (QFT-GIT) assay. TB testing is required even in individuals with a history of Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination. The Tuberculosis Screening Documentation Form can be viewed and downloaded at [pa.rmuohp.link/TBScreeningForm](http://pa.rmuohp.link/TBScreeningForm). If TB testing is positive, evaluation (and treatment if indicated) must be completed in accordance with CDC guidelines. In such cases, students should contact the PA program for details concerning additional documentation requirements.

## Health Information Release

In order for students to participate as active learners in the healthcare setting, clinical sites hosting SCPEs will require a copy of students' immunization history/status and tuberculosis screening results. To facilitate provision of this information, the PA Program requires prematriculants to sign a Health Information Release Form, available to view and download at [pa.rmuohp.link/HealthInfoReleaseForm](http://pa.rmuohp.link/HealthInfoReleaseForm), authorizing the RMUoHP PA Program to:

- Maintain a copy of this information in their program student record, and
- Release copies of this information to clinical sites where students will have SCPEs

## Certified Background Check

All prematriculants must obtain a certified background check. Applicants who are offered and accept seats in the program will receive an email with instructions on how to use [www.CertifiedBackground.com](http://www.certifiedbackground.com) to initiate a background check. 

Admittance to the PA Program is contingent on receipt of documentation of a successful background check. A background check revealing information prohibiting a student from participating in SCPEs or preventing him/her from obtaining licensure will render him/her ineligible for the program.

## Program Release, Consent, and Waiver

Multiple physical examination and skills activities are taught during the program. In addition to educating students in their roles' as practitioners, having students fill the role of patients during these activities helps them become sensitive to the patient perspective. Furthermore, active participation and repetition reinforce learning. 

The RMUoHP PA Program Release, Informed Consent, and Waiver Form provides important information regarding expectations of your participation as an active learner and indemnifies the University. This form is available to view and download at [pa.rmuohp.link/ReleaseWaiverForm](http://pa.rmuohp.link/ReleaseWaiverForm).

## Health Insurance Documentation

RMUoHP PA Program students are required to carry and maintain personal health insurance during their entire tenure at RMUoHP. Prematriculants are required to submit a Health Insurance Statement and sign a waiver assuming all financial responsibility for any illness or health care costs incurred throughout the course of their studies. Details are included in the Health Insurance Statement Form, available to view and download at [pa.rmuohp.link/HealthInsuranceStatementForm](http://pa.rmuohp.link/HealthInsuranceStatementForm). The [University website’s ‘Healthcare & Emergency Resources’ page](http://rmuohp.edu/students/student-services/healthcare-emergency-resources/) includes additional helpful information. 

## Multimedia Consent/Release Form

This document provides permission for RMUoHP to utilize your photographed image, videotaped image, and/or recorded voice for educational purposes. This form is available to view and download at [pa.rmuohp.link/MultimediaConsentForm](http://pa.rmuohp.link/MultimediaConsentForm).

## Official Transcripts of All Coursework

Official transcripts of all coursework, including courses completed following e-submission of one's [CASPA](https://portal.caspaonline.org/) application, must be received directly from institutions of origin. The RMUoHP Registrar's Office will receive transcripts and verify course completion and degree status prior to matriculation.

## Conditional Acceptance Documentation

When applicable, prematriculants must provide evidence of compliance with any conditional academic requirements, such as:

- **Completion of Bachelor’s Degree:** For those who have not yet earned one, successfully obtaining a Bachelor’s degree from a regionally accredited institution prior to starting the program is required. Official transcripts should be submitted to the program prior to matriculation. In the event the program begins prior to official transcripts becoming available, unofficial transcripts should be submitted until official transcripts become available to submit. 
- **Completion of Outstanding Prerequisites:** For those to whom it applies, outstanding prerequisite coursework must be completed with a grade of B or better. Official transcripts should be submitted to the program prior to matriculation. In the event the program begins prior to official transcripts becoming available, unofficial transcripts should be submitted until official transcripts become available to submit.

[^hepBnonconverter]: if you are a non-converter, please contact the program for additional details
[^varicella]: a history of previous infection is not sufficient evidence of immunity
[^mening]: the CDC recommends a 2-dose series for individuals with asplenia or complement deficiency
[^flu]: this is not required in cases where students learned of their acceptance into the program after the season of immunization availability concluded; students will be required to obtain influenza immunization annually while enrolled in the program
