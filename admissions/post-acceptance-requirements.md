## Certified Background Check Documentation

All prematriculants must obtain a certified background check through <www.CertifiedBackground.com>. Admittance to the PA Program is contingent on receipt of documentation of a successful background check. A background check revealing information that would prohibit a student from participating in clinical rotations or prevent him/her from obtaining licensure will render him/her ineligible for the program.
