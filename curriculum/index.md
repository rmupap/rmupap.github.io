### Supervised Clinical Practice Experiences

The final nine clinical practice experiences (SCPEs) serve as the culminating learning activities for students in the physician assistant program. During each rotation students work with certified practicing clinicians (referred to as preceptors) and actively participate in the delivery of patient-centered care as part of the health care team.

Each four-week core clinical practice rotation provides an opportunity to learn, understand, and gain supervised experience in practicing principles associated with rotation specific experiences.

Brief descriptions of each SCPE type is included below _(**please note:** students have already completed a Family Medicine or Primary Care rotation)_

* **Family Medicine Rotation**: The focus of this rotation is holistic, outpatient-based, relationship-centered care of patients of all ages. Emphases include management of commonly encountered primary care conditions, evidence-based preventive practices, and patient education.
* **Primary Care Rotation (Behavioral and Mental Health Care emphasis)**: Focus areas include diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders (pharmacotherapeutic and psychotherapeutic), health promotion and wellness, and appreciating the dynamic bidirectional influences between the psychosocial and all aspects of health and disease.
* **Primary Care Rotation (Rural and/or Underserved Care emphasis)**: The focus of this preceptorship is evaluation and management of commonly encountered primary care conditions in a rural and/or medically underserved setting for patients of all ages and cultural backgrounds.
* **Internal Medicine Rotation**: The focus of this preceptorship is providing longitudinal health care for patients with chronic health problems.
* **Pediatrics Rotation**: The focus of this preceptorship is acute and preventive health care for pediatric patients.
* **Obstetrics/Gynecology Rotation**: Focus for this preceptorship includes obstetrical, gynecologic, and women’s preventive care.
* **Emergency Medicine Rotation**: Emphasis of this preceptorship is evaluation and management of emergent medical conditions in the emergency department setting.
* **General Surgery Rotation**: This rotation provides exposure to the operating room setting and function. The focus of this preceptorship is on evaluation and care of patients with commonly encountered conditions requiring surgical management.
* **Inpatient Selective Rotation**: This mandatory rotation includes a focus on providing care in the inpatient setting and may be chosen from available medical or surgical (sub)specialty preceptorships with significant inpatient populations.
* **Open Elective Rotation**: This mandatory elective rotation provides students the opportunity to gain experience in a specific area of interest and may include a medical or surgical (sub)specialty, academic medicine, or medical research.
