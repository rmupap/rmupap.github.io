<h4 class="" id="700-1">PAS 702-703 Supervised Clinical Practice Experiences</h4> 

The first two supervised clinical practice experiences (SCPEs) are intentionally designed to place students into the real world of full-time patient care while in the midst of their didactic studies. Students are immersed in the experience of modern medical practice involving clinical reasoning, problem-solving, and accessing, interpreting, and applying high quality evidence-based information at the point-of-care. 

The first two SCPEs are designed to facilitate the clinical problem-solving emphasis of the program's experiential-based curriculum, empowering students with strong clinical perspectives for the remainder of their didactic studies and thus preparing them to grasp concepts of greater complexity. As a result, faculty are able to design and implement more complex learning experiences for the final two didactic semesters. Students are better prepared for and achieve greater depth of understanding resulting in better preparation to more fully engage in their final eight rotations thereafter. Family Medicine and Behavioral Health are chosen specifically to emphasize a relationship-centered, holistic approach to patient care. 

- **Family Medicine Rotation:** This core clinical practice rotation provides an opportunity to learn, understand, and gain supervised experience in practicing the principles of Family Medicine. The focus of this rotation is holistic, outpatient-based, relationship-centered care of patients of all ages. Emphases include prevention and wellness, patient education, and comprehensive management of commonly encountered primary care conditions.
- **Behavioral Health Rotation:** This core clinical practice rotation provides an opportunity to learn, understand, and gain supervised experience in practicing the principles of behavioral health. Areas of focus include health promotion and wellness as well as diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorers. A biopsychosocial approach to care is emphasized.

<h4 class="" id="700-2">PAS 704-711 Supervised Clinical Practice Experiences</h4> 

The final set of supervised clinical practice experiences (SCPEs) are the culminating learning activities for students in the physician assistant program. Over the course of the final two semesters, students participate in eight full-time core rotations including an inpatient selective and one open elective in any of the medical specialties or subspecialties, medical research, or medical academia. During each rotation students work with certified practicing clinicians (referred to as preceptors) and actively participate in the delivery of patient-centered care as part of the health care team. 

Each four-week core clinical practice rotation provides an opportunity to learn, understand, and gain supervised experience in practicing principles associated with rotation specific experiences. 

Brief descriptions of remaining practice areas are included below: 

- **Primary Care Rotation:** The focus of this preceptorship is evaluation and management of commonly encountered conditions in a medically underserved and/or rural setting for patients of all ages and cultural backgrounds. 
- **Internal Medicine Rotation:** The focus of this preceptorship is providing longitudinal health care for patients with chronic health problems.
- **Pediatrics Rotation:** The focus of this preceptorship is acute and preventive health care for pediatric patients.
- **Obstetrics/Gynecology Rotation:** Focus for this preceptorship includes obstetrical, gynecologic, and women’s preventive care.
