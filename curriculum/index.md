<h4 class="" id="700-1">PAS 702-703 Supervised Clinical Practice Experiences </h4> 

The first two supervised clinical practice experiences (SCPE) intentionally immerse students into the real world of patient care in the midst of their didactic studies. The practice of medicine has evolved dramatically and continues to change at a rapid pace. The educational challenge has become (much) less about memorizing mass amounts of information, and (much) more about clinical reasoning, problem-solving, and accessing, interpreting, and applying high quality evidence-based information at the point-of-care. The first two SCPEs are designed to facilitate the clinical problem-solving emphasis of the program's experiential-based curriculum, empowering students with strong clinical perspectives for the home stretch of their didactic studies. These two rotations prepare students to grasp concepts of greater complexity. As a result, faculty are able to design and implement meatier learning experiences to challenge students for the final two didactic semesters and students will be better prepared to dive into their final eight rotations thereafter. Family Medicine and Psychiatry are chosen specifically to emphasize a relationship-centered, holistic approach to patient care. 

- **Family Medicine Rotation:** This core clinical practice rotation provides an opportunity to learn, understand, and gain supervised experience in practicing the principles of Family Medicine. The focus of this preceptorship is holistic, outpatient-based, relationship-centered care of patients of all ages. Emphases include prevention and wellness, patient education, and comprehensive management of commonly encountered primary care conditions.
- **Psychiatry Rotation:** This core clinical practice rotation provides an opportunity to learn, understand, and gain supervised experience in practicing the principles of Psychiatry. The focus of this preceptorship is behavioral and psychiatric health care. Emphases include approaching diagnosis and management from a biopsychosocial clinical perspective.

<h4 class="" id="606">PAS 606 Dermatology </h4> 

This is one of several clinical medicine modular courses using an organ-systems approach. Commonly encountered medical problems primarily affecting the dermatologic system are examined. The clinical presentation, epidemiology, pathophysiology, patient assessment, diagnosis, pathology, therapeutic interventions, management, and clinical course of these conditions will be explored.

### Fall Semester - Year Two

<h4 class="" id="514">PAS 514 Professional Development IV </h4> 

The professional development sequence of courses spans nearly the entire program curriculum and is intended to introduce and integrate principles of professionalism, ethics, and the business of medicine with the practice of medicine. The fourth in this seven course sequence evaluates health care disparities and provider sensitivity to cultural diversity, socioeconomic differences, and their impact on health and wellness. Alternative, integrative and preventive approaches to health care are examined.

<h4 class="" id="693">PAS 693 Patient-Centered Care III</h4> 

The patient-centered care (PCC) sequence of courses is designed to challenge students to develop clinical reasoning skills, think critically, enhance interpersonal and communication skills, apply evidence-based resources, and problem-solve as clinicians and as members of an interdisciplinary health care team. The third PCC course again utilizes simulated cases where students will evaluate standardized patients. Emphasis will be placed on the following: comprehensive patient management, longitudinal management of established patients, admission orders, inpatient management, progress notes, discharge summaries, rehabilitative care, palliative care and end-of-life issues, and utilization of an electronic health care record.

<h4 class="" id="607">PAS 607 Cardiovascular/EKG</h4> 

This is one of several clinical medicine modular courses using an organ-systems approach. Commonly encountered medical problems primarily affecting the cardiovascular system are examined. The clinical presentation, epidemiology, pathophysiology, patient assessment, diagnosis, pathology, therapeutic interventions, management, and clinical course of these conditions will be explored.
