RMUoHP-PAP will educate outstanding physician assistant clinicians, equipped to handle the challenges of practicing medicine in a multifaceted and complex health care system. Our program will <span class="highlight">emphasize a holistic patient-centered care approach</span>, <span class="highlight">educating students not only in the foundational domains of medical knowledge and patient care</span>, but also to:

- approach complex health problems through sound clinical reasoning, **with sensitivity for** the unique situation and concerns of **each individual patient**,
- **leverage the powers of information technology and collaborative networking to make thoughtful, evidence-based decisions** at the point-of-care,  
- **master the art of connecting with patients** of diverse characteristics and backgrounds, and
- serve as **ethical professionals who stand as examples and leaders** in their communities and amongst their colleagues

### Genuiness and Honesty

Hmm, genuiness and honesty. Do these attributes both warrant exclusive attention? My 8th grade English teacher would probably argue to never include them in the same phrase, as most would conclude it a redundancy. However, I...

### Principle-Centered Pedagogy

### Active and Collaborative Learning  

><em>"Lecture is only one tool among many. The research shows that when students actively learn, they retain more. We will use all kinds of techniques in the classroom. The more creative, the better."</em>
>
>~ [David Payne PA-C](http://bit.ly/dP-CV), RMUPAP Program Director

A variety of pedagogical approaches will be employed beyond standard lecture, including case-based, problem-based, and team-based learning. Early in the didactic phase students will be introduced to working through clinical cases as members on a healthcare team. Emphasis will be placed on critical thinking, problem-solving, applying information mined from evidence-based resources, and developing interpersonal and communication skills. 



### Progressive Experiential Design  

><em>"Medicine today is all about problem-solving. The cup of medical knowledge is far greater than any one person could consume in a lifetime. Having a strong foundation of medical knowledge as a base, and then having the ability to solve problems through a network of colleagues and by quickly accessing, interpreting, and applying high-quality evidence-based information at the point-of-care, will be of far greater value than attempting to memorize an infinite number of details about disease diagnosis and management."</em>
>
>~ [David Payne PA-C](http://bit.ly/dP-CV), RMUPAP Program Director

Beginning early in the didactic phase, students will be challenged to work through simulated clinical experiences with standardized patients (actors trained to portray specific patient presentations). These experiences will include presenting cases orally to faculty members simulating supervising practitioners and developing comprehensive notes, to include detailed assessments and management plans. A semester of full-time clinical rotations will also break up the didactic phase of the program, enabling students to learn subsequent didactic material with a newly formed clinical perspective.

### Technology Prowess

- insert here

### Integrated Medical Curricula

The didactic medical curricula is comprised of **synthesized medicine modules**. Instead of courses addressing content separately in clinical medicine, diagnostic skills, and pharmacotherapeutics courses, these components will be integrated into specialty-based module courses (e.g. Cardiovascular, Pulmonology, Pediatrics). This provides an empowering information framework for students, thereby optimizing study effectiveness and improving retention of learned material.

### Emphasizing the "Other Four Competencies"

- insert here

### Self-Reflective Practice Portfolio

Rather than traditional research papers for their capstone project, students will develop _self-reflective practice portfolios_. Throughout the didactic phase of the program, students will be challenged to reflect deeply on their knowledge and skill base. They will identify and quantify their strengths and weaknesses, and then be responsible for developing specific plans to address their weaknesses. During the final two semesters, they will put their plans into action and self-monitor their progress. This project will help prepare well-rounded graduates who have cultivated a consistent pattern of self-reflective practice, a skill crucial for optimal performance within a practice climate of rapid knowledge advancement.

If you have not done so already, feel free to schedule a brief phone appointment with the **Admissions Office (801.375.5125)**, so any remaining questions you have about the program can be addressed.

Thanks!

## Additional Details Regarding Accreditation

The purpose of accreditation is to establish and maintain standards of quality. The [Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (ARC-PA)][arc] is the agency authorized to accredit PA Educational Programs in the United States.

Rocky Mountain University of Health Professions PA Program (RMUoHP-PAP) is not accredited at this time, but has entered the process to earn accreditation.

A formal application for _Accreditation - Provisional_ will be submitted to the ARC-PA in September 2014. A formal site visit will be conducted shortly thereafter in November 2014. Members of the ARC-PA commision will convene in March of 2015 to render a decision on RMUoHP-PAP's accreditation status, prior to anticipated matriculation of the inaugural RMUoHP-PAP class in June 2015.

The ARC-PA describes the provisional accreditation process as follows:

> <em>Accreditation - Provisional</em> is an accreditation status granted when the plans and resource allocation, if fully implemented as planned, of a proposed program that has not yet enrolled students appear to demonstrate the program’s ability to meet the [ARC-PA Standards][standards] or when a program holding accreditation-provisional status appears to demonstrate continued progress in complying with the Standards as it prepares for the graduation of the first class (cohort) of students.
> 
> The provisional accreditation process begins with a thorough review of the planning, organization, and proposed content of a program that is in the advanced planning stages, but not yet operational. The provisional accreditation pathway is the only entry way for proposed new programs into the accreditation process.

### Implications for RMUoHP-PAP Applicants

Only graduates of programs accredited by the ARC-PA or its predecessors are eligible to take the [Physician Assistant National Certifying Examination][pance] ([PANCE][pance]). Certification is required to be eligible for licensure to practice as a Physician Assistant.

The RMUoHP-PAP application cycle for the inaugural class anticipated to matriculate in June 2015 will run from April 21st through December 2014. Applications will be evaluated, candidates will be interviewed, and seats will be offered prior to March 2015, the month when the official decision will be rendered as to whether RMUoHP-PAP has received accreditation.

In the event RMUoHP-PAP is not awarded accreditation for its PA Program in March 2015, the inaugural class will not matriculate in June 2015. Therefore, candidates who accept a seat for the inaugural class are doing so with the understanding that the program will begin contingent on successfully being awarded the status of _Accreditation - Provisional_. 

Rocky Mountain University is committed to developing a high quality physician assistant program. If for any reason matriculation is delayed, those accepted into the program would have the option of holding their seats, until such time that accreditation is achieved and the inaugural class launches.
