  <h2 id="information-regarding-accreditation">Information Regarding Accreditation</h2>

<p>Thank you for your interest in the Rocky Mountain University of Health Professions Physician Assistant Program (RMUoHP-PAP). We are excited to develop an innovative new program designed to educate reflective professionals who value and practice evidence-based, patient-centered care!</p>

<p>RMUoHP-PAP is in the process of applying for <em>Accreditation - Provisional</em> from the <a href="http://www.arc-pa.org/">Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant</a> (<a href="http://www.arc-pa.org/">ARC-PA</a>). RMUoHP-PAP anticipates matriculating its first class on June 1, 2015, pending achieving <em>Accreditation - Provisional</em> status at the March 2015 ARC-PA meeting. <em>Accreditation - Provisional</em> is an accreditation status for a new PA program that, at the time of its initial accreditation review, demonstrated its preparedness to initiate a program in accordance with the <a href="http://www.arc-pa.org/acc_standards/">accreditation Standards</a>.</p>

<h2 id="application-timeline-information">Application Timeline Information</h2>

<p>The application cycle for the inaugural class anticipated to matriculate on June 1st, 2015, pending achieving <em>Accreditation - Provisional</em> status in March 2015, will run from April 21st, 2014 through December 2014. Interested individuals will be required to apply through the <a href="https://portal.caspaonline.org/">Central Application Service for Physician Assistants</a> (<a href="https://portal.caspaonline.org/">CASPA</a>).</p>

<h3 id="application-deadline">Application Deadline</h3>

<p>To be considered for an interview, <strong>all</strong> materials must be received <strong>and VERIFIED</strong> by <a href="https://portal.caspaonline.org/">CASPA</a> <strong>no later than November 1st</strong>. The following language from CASPA’s website is informative:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…To ensure the application is verified on time, applications must be completed (e-submitted, payment received, transcripts received, and two letters of recommendation received) at least four weeks in advance of the deadline date.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, ensure that all of your materials have been submitted around October 1st if you want to ensure your application will be scored.  </p>

<h3 id="early-consideration-deadline">Early Consideration Deadline</h3>

<p>Applicants who have their applications <strong>VERIFIED by <a href="https://portal.caspaonline.org/">CASPA</a> by September 1st will receive early consideration</strong>. At this time, those who meet a pre-determined application scoring threshold will be invited for an interview, and accordingly, may be offered a seat for our inaugural class, prior to the designated final application deadline of November 1st. </p>

<p class="message">
  <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> &nbsp;Because this is RMUoHP-PAP's first application cycle, we are not able to predict, nor can we even estimate, the number of applicants who will have submitted their materials promptly enough for early consideration. <strong>We do not plan to constrain offers to an arbitrary percentage of total available seats</strong>. In other words, if we receive 500 qualifying applications by the early consideration deadline, and as a result we interview 100 of these individuals, it is possible that we could fill the entire inaugural class with the pool of applicants who submitted in time for early consideration.
</p>

<h2 id="standardized-test-scores">Standardized Test Scores</h2>

<h3 id="graduate-record-examination-gre">Graduate Record Examination (GRE)</h3>

<p>All test scores are sent directly to <a href="https://portal.caspaonline.org/">CASPA</a> by the Educational Testing Service (ETS). Reapplicants will be required to request that ETS send official scores for each subsequent future application. </p>

Additionally, <strong>an Analytical Writing score of at least 3.0 is required</strong>.

<blockquote>
