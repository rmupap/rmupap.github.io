  	<h2 id="information-regarding-accreditation">Information Regarding Accreditation</h2>

<p>Thank you for your interest in the Rocky Mountain University of Health Professions Physician Assistant Program (RMUoHP-PAP). <span class="highlight">We are excited to develop an innovative new program designed to educate reflective professionals who value and practice evidence-based, patient-centered care!</span></p>

<p>RMUoHP-PAP is in the process of applying for ‘Accreditation-Provisional’ from the <a href="http://www.arc-pa.org/">Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant</a> (<a href="http://www.arc-pa.org/">ARC-PA</a>). <strong>RMUoHP-PAP anticipates starting its first class on June 1, 2015, pending achieving ‘Accreditation-Provisional’ status at the March 2015 ARC-PA meeting.</strong> ‘Accreditation-Provisional’ is an accreditation status for a new PA program that, at the time of its initial accreditation review, demonstrated its preparedness to initiate a program in accordance with the <a href="http://www.arc-pa.org/acc_standards/">Accreditation Standards</a>.</p>

<h2 id="application-timeline-information">Application Timeline Information</h2>

<p><strong>The application cycle for the inaugural class anticipated to matriculate on June 1st, 2015</strong>, pending achieving ‘Accreditation-Provisional’ status in March 2015, <span class="highlight">will run from April 21st, 2014 through December 2014</span>. Interested individuals must apply through the <a href="https://portal.caspaonline.org/">Central Application Service for Physician Assistants</a> (<a href="https://portal.caspaonline.org/">CASPA</a>).</p>

<h3 id="application-deadline">Application Deadline</h3>

<p>To be considered for an interview, <span class="highlight">all materials must be received and VERIFIED by CASPA no later than November 1st</span>. The following language from CASPA’s website is informative:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…To ensure the application is verified on time, applications must be completed (e-submitted, payment received, transcripts received, and two letters of recommendation received) at least four weeks in advance of the deadline date.</p>

  <p><span class="reference"><a href="https://portal.caspaonline.org/caspaHelpPages/frequently-asked-questions/school-information/deadlines/">~ reference link</a></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, ensure that all of your materials have been submitted around October 1st if you want to ensure your application will be scored. </p>

<h3 id="early-consideration-deadline">Early Consideration Deadline</h3>

<p>Applicants who have their <span class="highlight">applications VERIFIED by CASPA by September 1st will receive early consideration</span>. At this time, those who meet a pre-determined application scoring threshold will be invited for an interview, and accordingly, may be offered a seat for our inaugural class, prior to the designated final application deadline of November 1st. </p>

<p class="message">
  <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> &nbsp;Because this is RMUoHP-PAP's first application cycle, we are not able to predict, nor can we even estimate, the number of applicants who will have submitted their materials promptly enough for early consideration. <span class="highlight">We do not plan to constrain offers to an arbitrary percentage of total available seats</span>. In other words, if we receive 500 qualifying applications by the early consideration deadline, and as a result we interview 100 of these individuals, it is possible that we could fill the entire inaugural class with the pool of applicants who submitted in time for early consideration.
</p>

<h2 id="academic-requirements">Academic Requirements</h2>

<h3 id="degree-requirements">Degree Requirements</h3>

<p>All applicants <strong>must have completed a bachelor’s degree or higher from a regionally accredited institution prior to matriculation into the program</strong>. Degrees earned from outside the United States must be evaluated for and meet United States equivalency as described in the ‘Foreign Student Applicants’ section.</p>

<h3 id="gpa-requirements">GPA Requirements</h3>

<p>The <strong>minimum required cumulative GPA is 3.20</strong> and the <strong>minimum required science GPA is 3.00</strong>. However, <span class="highlight">applicants with lower GPAs will be considered</span> for interview <span class="highlight">when there is strong evidence of improved academic performance in more recently completed coursework</span> as evidenced by meeting the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="highlight">Cumulative GPA of 3.40 or higher</span> for the <span class="highlight">most recent 30 semester hours</span>…  </li>
  <li><span class="highlight">Fifteen or more</span> of which must be <span class="highlight">prerequisite science or upper-level science courses (300 level or higher)</span></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="health-care-experience">Health Care Experience</h2>

<p>Our primary goals in requiring applicants to have health care experience include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>For applicants to know they will be comfortable working intimately with patients of various shape and size who will manifest with a variety of conditions and diseases</li>
  <li>For applicants to understand:
    <ul>
      <li>the physician assistant profession,</li>
      <li>the significant differences between PAs and other practitioners including allied health providers,</li>
      <li>how PAs operate within the medical system</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="direct-patient-contact-experience">Direct Patient Contact Experience</h3>

<p>To be considered for an interview, <span class="highlight">applicants must have 250 hours or more of direct patient contact experience</span>. </p>

<p>Examples of <strong>specific positions that would qualify for direct patient contact experience include</strong> but are not limited to:  </p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Athletic Trainer</td>
      <td>Chiropractor</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Dental Hygienist</td>
      <td>Dentist</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Dietician</td>
      <td>Emergency Room Technician</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Home Health Aide</td>
      <td>Medical/Nursing Assistant</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Midwife</td>
      <td>Military Medic or Corpsman</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Nurse (LPN, RN)</td>
      <td>Occupational Therapist</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ophthalmology Technician</td>
      <td>Paramedic/EMT</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Patient Care Technician</td>
      <td>Phlebotomist</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Physical Therapist</td>
      <td>Physical Therapy Assistant</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Radiologic Technician</td>
      <td>Respiratory Therapist</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Surgical Technologist</td>
      <td> </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Volunteer experience with which</strong> <span class="highlight">you have actively worked with patients and influenced their care</span> <strong>also qualifies for direct patient contact experience</strong>. Examples may include but are not limited to:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Hospice</td>
      <td>Medical Mission</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Nursing Home</td>
      <td>Peace Corps</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Other health care experiences having minimal or no direct patient care responsibility, such as administrative jobs and pharmacy assistant, do not count for direct patient contact experience.</p>

<h3 id="provider-shadowing">Provider Shadowing</h3>

<p><strong>Shadowing</strong> medical providers <strong>is particularly valuable when considering a career as a physician assistant</strong>. We <span class="highlight">highly recommend that applicants shadow a primary care PA</span> (i.e. one who practices in a general medicine area such as family medicine or internal medicine), <span class="highlight">a PA who practices in a specialty</span>, <span class="highlight">and at least one physician</span>. Additional shadowing of various types of providers will only further strengthen your application. </p>

<p>Remember, the <strong>goal in shadowing is for applicants to have sufficient exposure to medical providers so they understand well the PA profession, including how PAs differ from other providers and how they operate within the medical industry</strong>.</p>

<p class="message">
<strong>Please Note:</strong> Provider shadowing generally <strong>does not</strong> qualify for direct patient contact experience. <span class="highlight">When shadowing, hours for direct patient contact experience should be considered only in circumstances where applicants have an opportunity to substantially engage in, and influence, care.</span>
</p>

<h2 id="standardized-test-scores">Standardized Test Scores</h2>

<h3 id="graduate-record-examination-gre">Graduate Record Examination (GRE)</h3>
