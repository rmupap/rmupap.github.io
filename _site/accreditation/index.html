  <h1 class="page-title">Accreditation</h1>
  <h2 id="physician-assistant-program-accreditation">Physician Assistant Program Accreditation</h2>

<p>The purpose of accreditation is to establish and maintain standards of quality. The <a href="http://www.arc-pa.org">Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (ARC-PA)</a> is the agency authorized to accredit PA Educational Programs in the United States.</p>

<p>Rocky Mountain University of Health Professions PA Program (RMUPAP) is not accredited at this time, but has entered the process to receive accreditation.</p>

<p>A formal application for <em>Accreditation - Provisional</em> will be submitted to the ARC-PA in September 2014. A formal site visit will be conducted shortly thereafter in November 2014. Members of the ARC-PA commision will convene in March of 2015 to render a decision on RMUPAP’s accreditation status, prior to anticipated matriculation of the inaugural RMUPAP class in June 2015.</p>

<p>The ARC-PA describes the provisional accreditation process as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Accreditation - Provisional is an accreditation status granted when the plans and resource allocation, if fully implemented as planned, of a proposed program that has not yet enrolled students appear to demonstrate the program’s ability to meet the <a href="http://www.arc-pa.org/acc_standards/">ARC-PA Standards</a> or when a program holding accreditation-provisional status appears to demonstrate continued progress in complying with the Standards as it prepares for the graduation of the first class (cohort) of students.</p>

  <p>The provisional accreditation process begins with a thorough review of the planning, organization, and proposed content of a program that is in the advanced planning stages, but not yet operational. The provisional accreditation pathway is the only entry way for proposed new programs into the accreditation process.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="implications-for-rmupap-applicants">Implications for RMUPAP Applicants</h2>

<p>Only graduates of programs accredited by the ARC-PA or its predecessors are eligible to take the <a href="https://www.nccpa.net/pance">Physician Assistant National Certifying Examination</a> (<a href="https://www.nccpa.net/pance">PANCE</a>). Certification is required to be eligible for licensure to practice as a Physician Assistant.</p>

<p>The RMUPAP application cycle for the inaugural class anticipated to matriculate in June 2015 will run from April 20th through December 2014. Applications will be evaluated, candidates will be interviewed, and seats will be offered prior to March 2015, the month when the official decision will be rendered as to whether the RMUPAP has received accreditation.</p>

<p>In the event RMUPAP is not awarded accreditation for its PA Program in March 2015, the inaugural class will not be matriculated in June 2015. Therefore, candidates who accept a seat for the inaugural class are doing so with the understanding that the program will begin contingent on successfully being awarded the status of <em>Accreditation - Provisional</em>.</p>
