We have designed this page to help propsective applicants determine if our program will be a good fit.[^fit] 

For starters, if you have not done so already, please check out our <a href="/core-values" target="_blank">Core Values</a> and <a href="/mission-vision-goals" target="_blank">Mission, Vision, & Goals</a> pages. Everything you read therein should resonate with you. For example, do you agree with our first core value?... the '**R**' in **R.I.G.H.T**, that '**Relationships Come First**'? What about the '**H**', referring to '**High Expectations**'? Do you set high expectations of yourself, and agree that patients deserve the best we have to give?

What are your thoughts when pondering our <a href="/mission-vision-goals" target="_blank">Mission, Vision, & Goals</a>? Are you committed to providing comprehensive, evidence-based, patient-centered care? Do you possess an insatiable thirst for learning? Are you willing to critically reflect upon your personal strengths and weaknesses, and make changes where appropriate? Are you humble, teachable, and willing to take in feedback that might not be so enjoyable to hear? Are you comfortable with technology and willing to learn how to maximize its use to optimize patient care? Finally, are you the type of person who is willing to serve as an active member of your community and assume leadership roles within the PA profession and elsewhere?

If you feel significant reservation about answering 'yes' to any of the above, it may be in your best interests to apply to other programs. **If you find yourself nodding again and again, this program will likely be a great fit and you should continue reading!** 

Below we have included some program highlights. This is certainly not an all-inclusive list, but should nevertheless offer you a taste of why we are so excited to launch this program!

### Active and Collaborative Learning

### Integrated Medical Curricula

### Principle-Centered Pedagogy

### Enhanced Focus on 'the Other Four' Core Competencies

The Physician Assistant profession has adopted six core competencies: 

1. _**medical knowledge (MK)**_,
2. **_patient care (PC)_**,
3. **_interpersonal and communication skills (ICS)_**,
4. **_professionalism (PR)_**,
5. **_practice-based learning and improvement (PBLI)_**, 
6. and **_systems based care (SBC)_**

Historically in formalized medical education, the vast bulk of emphasis has been placed on the first two, **_MK_** and **_PC_**. 

**Not enough attention** has been given to 'the other four'.

With RMUoHP's PA program, we have intentionally designed into several courses learning experiences, assignments, and/or projects that give due justice to _ICS_, _PR_, _PBLI_, and _SBC_. Furthermore, the progressive experiential nature of the program provides faculty with enhanced opportunities to develop learning experiences that will challenge students beyond the domains of **_MK_** and **_PC_**, in particular incorporating many subtleties and nuances involved with the _ICS_, _PR_, and _SBC_ domains. Finally, the design of the program capstone project (see below for more information) heavily emphasizes the oft-overlooked competency of **_PBLI_**.

### Self-Reflective Practice Portfolio

If you have not done so already, feel free to schedule a brief phone appointment with the **Admissions Office (801.375.5125)**, so any remaining questions you have about the program can be addressed.

Thanks!
