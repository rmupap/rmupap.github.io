Prerequisites 

</li>

<li style="font-size:90%">

<div class="faq-question">Do all of the program prerequisites need to be completed prior to application?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-purple">No. However, as described on the <a href="/admissions/prerequisite-courses">Prerequisite Courses</a> page, those applicants who have outstanding prerequisite coursework at the time of application must have a feasible plan documented for completing remaining prerequisites prior to the program start date. Furthermore, applicants offered seats contingent upon successful completion of outstanding prerequisites must complete each remaining course with a grade of “B” or better.</div>

<div class="faq-question">I completed a one semester course for Anatomy and Physiology. Will this work?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-purple">No. To meet the Human Anatomy and Physiology prerequisite requirement, applicants must take two courses, one for Human Anatomy and one for Human Physiology. A two-semester combined Human Anatomy and Physiology course series is also acceptable. These courses should be those required of majors in Biology or Physiology. Animal-based anatomy and physiology courses are not acceptable, even if you are majoring in Biology and your major does not require human anatomy and physiology.</div>

<div class="faq-question">Can a single course be used to satisfy more than one prerequisite?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-purple">No.</div>

<div class="faq-question">Regarding the Verbal (V) and Quantitative (Q) GRE aggregate (V+Q) score requirement of 294 and Analytical Writing (A) score requirement of 3.0, if I do not meet one of these score requirements, can I still qualify if my score surpassed the requirement in the other? For example, would I qualify with a V+Q aggregate score of 291 and an A score of 4.0?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-purple">No. Even though the Analytical Writing score would be sufficient, the minimum must be met for both scores.</div>

Admissions Process

</li>
		
<li style="font-size:90%">

<div class="faq-question">When will your inaugural cohort begin class?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-grey">Our inaugural cohort will begin on Monday, May 4, 2015 (pending successfully being awarded 'Accreditation - Provisional' in March 2015). To learn details regarding accreditation, please navigate to our <a href="/accreditation">Accreditation</a> web page.</div>

<div class="faq-question">Will you be using the Central Application Service for Physician Assistants (CASPA)?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-grey">Yes. Interested applicants must apply through CASPA. <a href="Click here to go to CASPA's website" target="_blank">Click or tap here to navigate to CASPA's website</a>.</div>

<div class="faq-question">When will the application cycle open for the inaugural class?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-grey">It already opened... on April 21st. Applicants can select our program to receive their application via the CASPA website.</div>

<div class="faq-question">Will there be a supplementary application?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-grey">No.</div>

<div class="faq-question">How many applicants do you expect will apply for the inaugural class?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-grey">This is difficult to predict. Already there is great enthusiasm about our new program and it appears word is spreading quickly. At the time of this writing (August 22, 2014), we have a substantial volume of applicants who have designated our program to receive an application via CASPA. Applicants who are interested in our program should not delay submitting materials. To meet our final deadline of November 1st, applicants should ensure their CASPA application is completed no later than four weeks in advance (first part of October). More details are available on our <a href="/admissions/application-requirements">Application Requirements</a> page.</div>

Length of Program

</li>
		
<li style="font-size:90%">

<div class="faq-question">What is the length of the entire program?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-purple">Seven consecutive semesters spanning 28 months.</div>

<div class="faq-question">How many semesters are didactic and how many are clinical?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-purple">Four didactic semesters and three clinical semesters.</div>

<div class="faq-question">I heard you will be offering a full-time clinical rotation to break up the didactic phase. Is this true? If so, why?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-purple">Yes, it's true. Why? Because it just makes sense. This unique aspect of our program is exciting! The practice of medicine has evolved dramatically and continues to change at a rapid pace. Consequently, the educational challenge has become (much) less about memorizing mass amounts of information, and (much) more about clinical reasoning, problem-solving, and accessing, interpreting, and applying high quality evidence-based information at the point-of-care. The purpose of including a full-time clinical rotation in the midst of the didactic phase is to facilitate the clinical problem-solving emphasis. This will empower students with a substantially more mature clinical perspective for their remaining didactic content. Because students will be prepared to grasp concepts of greater complexity, faculty will be able to design and implement meatier learning experiences.</div>

Academics and Credentials

</li>

<li style="font-size:90%">

<div class="faq-question">What degree will be rewarded by the program?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-grey">Upon successful completion of the program, Rocky Mountain University of Health Professions (RMUoHP) will award students with a Master of Physician Assistant Studies (MPAS) degree. A master's degree is considered the terminal practice degree for physician assistants.</div>

<div class="faq-question">Does the program offer a part-time option?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-grey">No. The program is a cohort-based, lock-step experience. Courses are designed and sequenced carefully so as to allow students to progressively build upon previously learned material.</div>

<div class="faq-question">Will a cadaver lab be included as part of the Applied Human Anatomy course?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-grey">Yes. RMUoHP employs a full-time PhD-trained anatomist who will serve as director over the lab. Four-five prosected cadavers will be available for laboratory learning experiences.</div>

Class Size

</li>
		
<li style="font-size:90%">
<div class="faq-question">How many seats are available for the inaugural class? How about each class annually thereafter?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-grey">Our goal is to seat 46 students for the inaugural class and 50 students each class thereafter. However, we will only seat as many as we feel confident we can accommodate with strong clinical rotations.
</div>

<li><span class="faq-header-purple">?</span>

Background Check

</li>

<li style="font-size:90%">

<div class="faq-question">Will a background check be required for incoming students? If so, why?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-purple">Admittance to the program will be contingent upon a successful background check. A background check revealing information that would prohibit a student from participating in clinical rotations or prevent licensure will make him/her ineligible for the program.</div>

</li>

<li><span class="faq-header-grey">?</span>

Drug Screening

</li>

<li style="font-size:90%">

<div class="faq-question">Will drug screening be performed on students?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-grey">Yes. Enrolled students will be subject to random drug screenings at any point during the course of the program. Failure to perform or successfully pass a drug screen will render the student ineligible for clinical rotations and will thus result in dismissal from the program.</div>

Financials and Living

</li>

<li style="font-size:90%">

<div class="faq-question">How much will the program cost?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-purple">At this time, we anticipate a cost of $91,649 for tuition plus fees. Because RMUoHP is a private institution, the same cost applies to both in-state and out-of-state students. As of this writing (2014-04-02), the average total cost for programs nationwide (non-resident and private) was in the low to mid-80K range.</div>

<div class="faq-question">In the answer above, why didn't you compare RMUoHP's cost against resident tuition rates?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-purple">RMUoHP is a private university. As such, comparable programs to evaluate us against would be those housed in other private institutions. Only about 1/3 of PA programs nationwide are state institutions having the ability to offer discounted resident tuition rates.</div>

<div class="faq-question">Will financial aid be available?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-purple">RMUoHP participates in the Federal Direct Student Loan (Stafford/PLUS) program, commonly referred to as “federal student loans,” offered through the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/" target="_blank">US Department of Education</a> (<a href="http://www.ed.gov/" target="_blank">ED</a>). Eligibility for federally-funded financial aid is established by the US Department of Education regulations. All of RMUoHP’s existing graduate programs are eligible for Federal Direct Student Loans. We are currently in the process of obtaining formal approval for the PA Program and do not anticipate any eligibility problems. For more information, go to RMUoHP's Financial Aid web page by <a href="http://rmuohp.edu/students/student-services/financial-aid/" target="_blank">clicking here</a>.</div>

<div class="faq-question">What advice would you give students who are interested in working part-time during the program?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-purple">Don't do it! PA school is exceptionally rigorous. Most students who attempt to work end up quitting their jobs or dropping out of the program within a few short months after matriculating. Think about it this way... most students will end up working as Physician Assistants for 35-45 years following graduation. Are you really planning to compromise the core education you will receive during the critical 2.5-year foundational period while in school, just so you can earn what will likely be a relatively small sum of money?</div>

<div class="faq-question">Does Provo, UT have a reasonable cost of living?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-purple">Very reasonable! The cost-of-living index (COLI) is a measure intended to help one compare living expenses in one locale versus another. An index of 100 indicates a cost of living equal to the national average. An index of 120 indicates the need to earn an additional 20% income in order to maintain the same standard of living as a city with an index of 100. At the time of this writing (2014-04-02) the COLI for Provo, UT was 88, which is very attractive for students on a tight budget!</div> 

<div class="faq-question">How livable is Provo, UT?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-purple">Provo is rated 'Exceptionally Livable' by <a href="http://www.areavibes.com/provo-ut/livability/" target="_blank">areavibes.com</a>. Check out the interactive block below... can't get much better than a 9.7 out of 10 in amenities!</div>
