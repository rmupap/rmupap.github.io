Length of Program

</li>
		
<li style="font-size:90%">

<div class="faq-question">What is the length of the entire program?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-purple">Eight consecutive semesters spanning 31 months.</div>

<div class="faq-question">How many semesters are didactic and how many are clinical?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-purple">Five didactic semesters and three clinical semesters.</div>

<div class="faq-question">I heard you will be offering a couple of full-time clinical rotations to break up the didactic phase. Is this true? If so, why?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-purple">Yes, it's true. Why? Because it just makes sense. This unique aspect of our program is exciting! The practice of medicine has evolved dramatically and continues to change at a rapid pace. Consequently, the educational challenge has become (much) less about memorizing mass amounts of information, and (much) more about clinical reasoning, problem-solving, and accessing, interpreting and applying high quality evidence-based information at the point-of-care. The purpose of including two full-time clinical rotations in the midst of the didactic phase is to facilitate the clinical problem-solving emphasis. This empowers students with a substantially more mature clinical perspective for the two final didactic semesters. Because they are prepared to grasp concepts of greater complexity, faculty are able to design and implement meatier learning experiences.</div>

Class Size

<li style="font-size:90%">
<div class="faq-question">How many seats are available for the inaugural class? How about each class annually thereafter?</div>

Prerequisites 

</li>

<li style="font-size:90%">

<div class="faq-question">Do all of the program prerequisites need to be completed prior to application?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-purple">No. However, as described on the <a href="/admissions/prerequisite-courses">Prerequisite Courses</a> page, those applicants who have outstanding prerequisite coursework at the time of application must have a feasible plan documented for completing remaining prerequisites prior to the program start date. Furthermore, applicants offered seats contingent upon successful completion of outstanding prerequisites must complete each remaining course with a grade of “B” or better.</div>

Application Cycle
</li>
		
<li style="font-size:90%">

<div class="faq-question">When will your inaugural cohort begin class?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-grey">Our inaugural cohort will begin classes on June 1, 2015 pending successfully being awarded 'Accreditation - Provisional' in March 2015. To learn details regarding accreditation, please navigate to our <a href="/accreditation">Accreditation</a> web page.</div>

<div class="faq-question">Will you be using the Central Application Service for Physician Assistants (CASPA)?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-grey">Yes. Interested applicants must apply through CASPA. <a href="Click here to go to CASPA's website" target="_blank">Click or tap here to navigate to CASPA's website</a>.</div>

<div class="faq-question">When will the application cycle open for the inaugural class?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-grey">Applicants should be able to select our program via the CASPA website on April 21st.</div>

<div class="faq-question">Will there be a supplementary application?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-grey">No.</div>

<div class="faq-question">How many applicants do you expect will apply for the inaugural class?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-grey">This is difficult to predict. Already there is great enthusiasm about our new program and it appears word is spreading quickly. We also know that neighboring Physician Assistant programs receive a high number of applications from residents and students in Utah Valley. Applicants who are interested in our program should not delay submitting materials via CASPA once the cycle opens. To meet our early consideration deadline of September 1st, applicants should ensure their CASPA application is completed no later than four weeks in advance (first part of August). More details are available on our <a href="/admissions/application-requirements">Application Requirements</a> page.</div>

Background Check

</li>

<li style="font-size:90%">

<div class="faq-question">Will a background investigation be required for incoming students? If so, why?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-purple">Admittance to the program will be contingent upon a successful background check. A background check revealing information that would prohibit a student from participating in clinical rotations or prevent licensure will make him/her ineligible for the program.</div>

<li><span class="faq-header-grey">?</span>

Drug Screening

</li>

<li style="font-size:90%">

<div class="faq-question">Will drug screening be performed on students?</div>
<div class="faq-answer-grey">Yes. Enrolled students will be subject to random drug screenings at any point during the course of the program. Failure to perform or successfully pass a drug screen will render the student ineligible for clinical rotations and will thus result in dismissal from the program.</div>
