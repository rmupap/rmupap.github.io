><em>"Medicine today is all about problem-solving. The cup of medical knowledge is far greater than any one person could consume in a lifetime. Having a strong foundation of medical knowledge as a base, and then having the ability to solve problems through a network of colleagues and by quickly accessing, interpreting, and applying high-quality evidence-based information at the point-of-care, will be of far greater value than attempting to memorize an infinite number of details about disease diagnosis and management."</em>

Beginning early in the didactic phase, students will be challenged to work through simulated clinical experiences with standardized patients (actors trained to portray specific patient presentations). These experiences will include presenting cases orally to faculty members simulating supervising practitioners and developing comprehensive notes, to include detailed assessments and management plans. A semester of full-time clinical rotations will also break up the didactic phase of the program, enabling students to learn subsequent didactic material with a newly formed clinical perspective.
