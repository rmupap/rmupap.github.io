All applicants **must complete the required prerequisite coursework in the table below prior to beginning the Physician Assistant Program**. Every course need not be completed prior to application. However, for applicants to whom it applies, there must be a feasible plan documented for completing any outstanding prerequisites prior to the program start date. 

<p class="message"><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> Under no circumstances will applicants be allowed to begin the Physician Assistant Program if prerequisite coursework is not completed prior to the program start date.</p>

## Prerequisite Performance

**Prerequisite courses must be successfully completed with a grade of C or better**. In plus-minus grading systems, **a grade of C- does not qualify as a C**. Applicants offered seats contingent upon successful completion of outstanding prerequisites must complete each remaining course with a grade of B or better.[^grade]

## Prerequisite Timeline Requirements

To be considered for the Physician Assistant Program, <span class="highlight">each prerequisite course highlighted below must have been completed within ten years of the cohort start date</span>.

[^grade]: earning a grade of B- does not qualify as a B
[^anatomy]: a two-semester combined Human Anatomy and Physiology course series is acceptable
[^physiology]: a two-semester combined Human Anatomy and Physiology course series is acceptable
[^bio]: if the course and lab does not equate to 4 or more semester credits, a molecular or cellular biology course must also be completed
[^stats]: generally a three-credit Statistics course is required; a two-credit Statistics course only qualifies when included as part of the requirements for earning a graduate degree
[^extrabio]: though not mandatory, application scoring will improve with successful completion and high performance--more importantly, these courses help better prepare students for the rigors of PA program coursework
[^extrachem]: though not mandatory, application scoring will improve with successful completion and high performance--more importantly, these courses help better prepare students for the rigors of PA program coursework
