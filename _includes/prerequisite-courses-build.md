All applicants <span class="highlight">must complete the required prerequisite coursework in the table below prior to beginning the Physician Assistant Program</span>. **Every course need not be completed prior to application**. However, for applicants to whom it applies, there must be a feasible plan documented for completing any outstanding prerequisites prior to the program start date. 

Under no circumstances will applicants be allowed to begin the Physician Assistant Program if prerequisite coursework is not completed prior to the program start date.

## Prerequisite Performance

**Prerequisite courses must be successfully completed with a grade of "C" or better**. In plus-minus grading systems, **a grade of "C⎯" does not qualify as a "C"**. Applicants offered seats contingent upon successful completion of outstanding prerequisites must complete each remaining course with a grade of "B" or better.[^1]

## Prerequisite Timeline Requirements

To be considered for the Physician Assistant Program, <span class="highlight">each prerequisite course highlighted below must have been completed within ten years of the cohort start date</span>.
