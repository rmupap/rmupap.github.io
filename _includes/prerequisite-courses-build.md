All applicants **must complete the required prerequisite coursework in the table below prior to beginning the Physician Assistant Program**. Every course need not be completed prior to application. However, for applicants to whom it applies, there must be a feasible plan documented for completing any outstanding prerequisites prior to the program start date. 

Under no circumstances will applicants be allowed to begin the Physician Assistant Program if prerequisite coursework is not completed prior to the program start date.

## Prerequisite Performance

**Prerequisite courses must be successfully completed with a grade of C or better**. In plus-minus grading systems, **a grade of C- does not qualify as a C**. Applicants offered seats contingent upon successful completion of outstanding prerequisites must complete each remaining course with a grade of B or better.[^grade]

[^grade]: earning a grade of B- does not qualify as a B
[^anatomy]: a two-semester combined Human Anatomy and Physiology course series is acceptable
[^physiology]: a two-semester combined Human Anatomy and Physiology course series is acceptable
[^chem]: courses meeting degree requirements for Biology majors are not preferred but acceptable 
[^stats]: generally a three-credit Statistics course is required; a two-credit Statistics course only qualifies when included as part of the requirements for earning a graduate degree
[^extrabio]: though not mandatory, application scoring will improve with successful completion and high performance--more importantly, these courses help better prepare students for the rigors of PA program coursework
