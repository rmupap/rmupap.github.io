All applicants **must complete the required prerequisite coursework in the table below prior to beginning the Rocky Mountain University of Health Professions (RMUoHP) Physician Assistant (PA) Program**. Every course need not be completed prior to application. The RMUoHP PA program allows applicants to have up to nine credits of prerequisite coursework in progress or planned at the time of application submission to CASPA. A feasible plan to complete outstanding prerequisite coursework must be documented in the CASPA application. 

<p class="message"><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> Under no circumstances will applicants be allowed to begin the PA Program if prerequisite coursework is not completed prior to the program start date.</p>

## Prerequisite Performance

**Prerequisite courses must be successfully completed with a grade of C or better**. In plus-minus grading systems, **a grade of C- does not qualify as a C**. Applicants offered seats contingent upon successful completion of outstanding prerequisites must complete each remaining course with a grade of B or better.[^grade]

## Prerequisite Timeline Requirements

To be considered for the RMUoHP PA Program, <span class="highlight">each prerequisite course highlighted below must have been completed within ten years of the cohort start date</span>. Additionally, credits must have been earned from a regionally accredited institution and be verifiable through official transcripts, or accepted by a [National Association of Credentialing Evaluation Services](http://www.naces.org/) ([NACES](http://www.naces.org/)) accredited U.S. equivalency reporting agency ([click for more information](http://rmupap.github.io/admissions/application-requirements/#foreign-student-applicants)).

[^grade]: earning a grade of B- does not qualify as a B
[^anatomy]: a two-semester combined Human Anatomy and Physiology course series is acceptable
[^physiology]: a two-semester combined Human Anatomy and Physiology course series is acceptable
[^bio]: if the course and lab does not equate to 4 or more semester credits, a molecular or cellular biology course must also be completed
[^stats]: generally a three-credit Statistics course is required; a two-credit Statistics course only qualifies when included as part of the requirements for earning a graduate degree
[^extrabio]: though not mandatory, application scoring will improve with successful completion and high performance--more importantly, these courses help better prepare students for the rigors of PA program coursework
[^extrachem]: though not mandatory, application scoring will improve with successful completion and high performance--more importantly, these courses help better prepare students for the rigors of PA program coursework
