Applicants who have their applications **VERIFIED by [CASPA][caspa] by September 1st will receive early consideration**. At this time, those who meet a pre-determined application scoring threshold will be invited for an interview, and accordingly, may be offered a seat for our inaugural class, prior to the designated final application deadline of November 1st. 

<p class="message">
  <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> &nbsp;Because this is RMUoHP-PAP's first application cycle, we are not able to predict, nor can we even estimate, the number of applicants who will have submitted their materials promptly enough for early consideration. <strong>We do not plan to constrain offers to an arbitrary percentage of total available seats</strong>. In other words, if we receive 500 qualifying applications by the early consideration deadline, and as a result we interview 100 of these individuals, it is possible that we could fill the entire inaugural class with the pool of applicants who submitted in time for early consideration.
