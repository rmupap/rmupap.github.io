Applicants who have **all application materials, including GRE scores, VERIFIED by CASPA by September 1st will receive early consideration**. At this time, those who meet a pre-determined application scoring threshold will be invited for an interview, and accordingly, may be offered a seat for our inaugural class, prior to the designated final application deadline of October 1st. 

<p class="message">
  <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> &nbsp;Because this is only RMUoHP PA's second application cycle, it will be difficult to predict the number of applicants who will have submitted their materials promptly enough for early consideration. <strong>We do not plan to constrain offers to an arbitrary percentage of total available seats</strong>. Therefore, applicants with a strong interest in our program should aim to meet the early consideration deadline, so long In other words, if we receive 500 qualifying applications by the early consideration deadline, and as a result we interview 100 of these individuals, it is possible that we could fill the entire inaugural class with the pool of applicants who submitted in time for early consideration.
