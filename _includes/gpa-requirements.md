- **GPA of 3.20 or higher** for the **most recent CASPA verified 20 semester hours**... **ALL of which** must be prerequisite (not including Statistics, College Algebra, Psychology, or Medical Terminology) or upper-level science courses (300-level or higher not including courses labeled as 'independent study').
