The ARC-PA has granted **Accreditation-Provisional** status to the **Rocky Mountain University of Health Professions Physician Assistant Program** sponsored by **Rocky Mountain University of Health Professions**.

Accreditation-Provisional is an accreditation status granted when the plans and resource allocation, if fully implemented as planned, of a proposed program that has not yet enrolled students appear to demonstrate the programâ€™s ability to meet the [ARC-PA Standards][standards] or when a program holding Accreditation- Provisional status appears to demonstrate continued progress in complying with the Standards as it prepares for the graduation of the first class (cohort) of students. 

Accreditation-Provisional does not ensure any subsequent accreditation status. It is limited to no more than five years from matriculation of the first class.
