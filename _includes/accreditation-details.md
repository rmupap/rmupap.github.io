The purpose of accreditation is to establish and maintain standards of quality. The [Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (ARC-PA)][arc] is the agency authorized to accredit Physician Assistant (PA) educational programs in the United States.

Rocky Mountain University of Health Professions (RMUoHP) PA Program is not accredited at this time, but has entered the formal process to earn accreditation.

A formal application for 'Accreditation-Provisional' will be submitted to the ARC-PA in September 2014. A formal site visit will be conducted shortly thereafter in November 2014. Members of **the ARC-PA commision will convene in March of 2015 to render a decision on RMUoHP PA's accreditation status**, prior to anticipated matriculation of the inaugural RMUoHP PA class in May 2015.

The ARC-PA describes the provisional accreditation process as follows:

> 'Accreditation-Provisional' is an accreditation status granted when the plans and resource allocation, if fully implemented as planned, of a proposed program that has not yet enrolled students appear to demonstrate the programâ€™s ability to meet the [ARC-PA Standards][standards] or when a program holding accreditation-provisional status appears to demonstrate continued progress in complying with the Standards as it prepares for the graduation of the first class (cohort) of students.
> 
> The provisional accreditation process begins with a thorough review of the planning, organization, and proposed content of a program that is in the advanced planning stages, but not yet operational. The provisional accreditation pathway is the only entry way for proposed new programs into the accreditation process.
