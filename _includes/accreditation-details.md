The purpose of accreditation is to establish and maintain standards of quality. Rocky Mountain University of Health Professions (RMUoHP) has applied for Accreditation–Provisional from the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (ARC-PA). RMUoHP anticipates matriculating its first class in May 2015, pending achieving Accreditation–Provisional status at the March 2015 ARC-PA meeting. Accreditation–Provisional is an accreditation status for a new PA program that, at the time of its initial accreditation review, demonstrated its preparedness to initiate a program in accordance with the accreditation Standards.

The formal application for 'Accreditation-Provisional' was submitted to the ARC-PA in August 2014. A formal site visit will be conducted in November 2014. Members of **the ARC-PA commision will then convene in March of 2015 to render a decision on RMUoHP PA's accreditation status**, prior to anticipated matriculation of the inaugural RMUoHP PA class in May 2015.

The ARC-PA describes the provisional accreditation process as follows:

> 'Accreditation-Provisional' is an accreditation status granted when the plans and resource allocation, if fully implemented as planned, of a proposed program that has not yet enrolled students appear to demonstrate the program’s ability to meet the [ARC-PA Standards][standards] or when a program holding accreditation-provisional status appears to demonstrate continued progress in complying with the Standards as it prepares for the graduation of the first class (cohort) of students.
> 
> The provisional accreditation process begins with a thorough review of the planning, organization, and proposed content of a program that is in the advanced planning stages, but not yet operational. The provisional accreditation pathway is the only entry way for proposed new programs into the accreditation process.
