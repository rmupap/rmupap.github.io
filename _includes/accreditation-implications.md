Only graduates of programs accredited by the ARC-PA or its predecessors are eligible to take the [Physician Assistant National Certifying Examination][pance] ([PANCE][pance]). Certification is required to be eligible for licensure to practice as a Physician Assistant.

The RMUoHP-PAP **application cycle for the inaugural class anticipated to matriculate in June 2015 will run from April 21st through December 2014**. Applications will be evaluated, candidates will be interviewed, and seats will be offered prior to March 2015, the month when the official decision will be rendered as to whether RMUoHP-PAP has received accreditation.

In the event RMUoHP-PAP is not awarded accreditation for its PA Program in March 2015, the inaugural class will not matriculate in June 2015. Therefore, **candidates who accept a seat for the inaugural class are doing so with the understanding that the program will begin contingent on successfully being awarded the status of 'Accreditation-Provisional'**. 

**Rocky Mountain University is committed to developing a high quality physician assistant program.** If for any reason matriculation is delayed, those accepted into the program would have the option of holding their seats, until such time that accreditation is achieved and the inaugural class launches.
