Only graduates of programs accredited by the ARC-PA or its predecessors are eligible to take the [Physician Assistant National Certifying Examination][pance] ([PANCE][pance]). Certification is required to be eligible for licensure to practice as a PA.

The RMUoHP PA Program **application cycle for the inaugural class anticipated to matriculate in May 2015 will run from April 21st through January 2015**. Applications will be evaluated, candidates will be interviewed, and seats will be offered prior to March 2015, the month when the official decision will be rendered as to whether RMUoHP PA has received accreditation.

In the event RMUoHP is not awarded accreditation for its PA program in March 2015, the inaugural class will not matriculate in May 2015. Therefore, **candidates who accept a seat for the inaugural class are doing so with the understanding that the program will begin contingent on successfully being awarded the status of 'Accreditation-Provisional'**. 

**RMUoHP is committed to developing a high quality PA program.** If for any reason matriculation is delayed, those accepted into the program would have the option of holding their seats, until such time that accreditation is achieved and the inaugural class launches.
