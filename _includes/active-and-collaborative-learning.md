><em>"Lecture is only one tool among many. The research shows that when students actively learn, they retain more. We will use all kinds of techniques in the classroom. The more creative, the better."</em>

A variety of pedagogical approaches will be employed beyond standard lecture, including case-based, problem-based, and team-based learning. Early in the didactic phase students will be introduced to working through clinical cases as members on a healthcare team. Emphasis will be placed on critical thinking, problem-solving, applying information mined from evidence-based resources, and developing interpersonal and communication skills.
