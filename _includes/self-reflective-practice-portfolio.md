Rather than traditional research papers for their capstone project, students will develop _self-reflective practice portfolios_. Throughout the didactic phase of the program, students will be challenged to reflect deeply on their knowledge and skill base. They will identify and quantify their strengths and weaknesses, and then be responsible for developing specific plans to address their weaknesses. During the final two semesters, they will put their plans into action and self-monitor their progress. This project will help prepare well-rounded graduates who have cultivated a consistent pattern of self-reflective practice, a skill crucial for optimal performance within a practice climate of rapid knowledge advancement.
