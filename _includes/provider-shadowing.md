**Shadowing** medical providers **is particularly valuable when considering a career as a physician assistant**. We **highly recommend that applicants shadow a primary care PA** (i.e. one who practices in a general medicine area such as family medicine or internal medicine), **a PA who practices in a specialty**, **and at least one physician**. Additional shadowing of various types of providers will only further strengthen your application. 

Remember, the **goal in shadowing is for applicants to have sufficient exposure to medical providers so they understand well the PA profession, including how PAs differ from other providers and how they operate within the medical industry**.

<strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> Provider shadowing generally <strong>does not</strong> qualify for direct patient contact experience. <strong>When shadowing, hours for direct patient contact experience should be considered only in circumstances where applicants have an opportunity to substantially engage in, and influence, care.</strong>
