The didactic medical curricula is comprised of **synthesized medicine modules**. Instead of courses addressing content separately in clinical medicine, diagnostic skills, and pharmacotherapeutics courses, these components will be integrated into specialty-based module courses (e.g. Cardiovascular, Pulmonology, Pediatrics). This provides an empowering information framework for students, thereby optimizing study effectiveness and improving retention of learned material.
