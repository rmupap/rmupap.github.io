> <em>"With the empowerment potential information technology now provides, we have arrived at the point where it is no longer excusable to do anything less than fully apply its use in medical education. Students should be empowered with technology from day one. As new graduates, they should be wholly comfortable with finding high-quality, evidence-based information quickly, and then applying that information to the unique care of individual patients."

Due to recent advances in technology and the promise of further innovation, we find ourselves living in the midst of a remarkable transition in the nature of how we live and work. Never before has it been so easy to find information. Never before has there been such open accessibility to connecting with individuals of varying backgrounds and expertise.

Unfortunately, **despite the empowering nature of the digital age in which we live, many educational programs fail to take advantage of preparing their students to become highly proficient with technology resources and tools**. 

In our program, students will become adept at using a wide variety of technologies and digital tools. Consequentially, their ability to practice medicine effectively and efficiently will be optimized. **Digital concepts and practices they will be challenged to master include** but are not limited to:

- Personal knowledge management
- Note, record, and document templating
- Workflow acceleration techniques
- Operating system automations 
- Keyboarding shortcuts 
- Really simple syndication (RSS) 
- Real-time collaborative problem-solving
- Real-time collaborative document processing
- Collaborative networking
- Peronalized search aggregation techniques

**Digital tools and softwares they will take advantage of** include but are not limited to:

- Application and document launching softwares
- Text expansion softwares
- Cloud- and web-based data synchronization tools
- Notetaking and knowledge aggregation sofwares
- Point-of-care clinical tools
- Task and notification automation softwares
- Human-computer interface optimization tools
