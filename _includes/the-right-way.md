## RMUoHP-PAP Additional Core Values 

In addition to those above, RMUoHP-PAP espouses those listed below. **Our commitment is to provide the best education possible for our students. To achieve this, we strive to think, make decisions, and act in accordance with these core values**. As a natural extension, <span class="highlight">we strongly emphasize their importance and encourage their adoption to every student</span> we have the privilege of teaching and mentoring. <span class="highlight">As anchors, these values serve as the pillars upon which all else is in the program stands</span>. Endearingly the acronym **R.I.G.H.T.** is used to aid memory.

### <span class="highlight-rgt">R</span> - Relationships Come First

Nothing is more important than our relationships with others. **People are more important than things. It is _people_ who give care, and _people_ who receive care**. <span class="highlight">At RMUoHP-PAP, people come first</span>.

### <span class="highlight-ih">I</span> - It's All About the Team

Time and again we see the evidence. **Collective decision-making is superior to independent decision-making**. Whether it be in health care, education, business, or any other endeavor, the team approach proves best. <span class="highlight">At RMUoHP-PAP, we emphasize teamwork in all we do</span>.

### <span class="highlight-rgt">G</span> - Gotta Think of the Patient

The medical world is remarkably complex. So many dynamics, so many considerations. **Unfortunately, in the midst of the chaos, thinking about and doing what's best for the patient can slip to the back burner**. <span class="highlight">At RMUoHP-PAP, we keep the patient front and center. The patient comes first. Always</span>.

### <span class="highlight-ih">H</span> - High Expectations

Yes, we are here to serve students. But more importantly, we are here to serve the patients whom our students will serve. **Without high expectations, we risk compromising the education of our students, and thus ultimately the care of their patients**. <span class="highlight">RMUoHP-PAP holds the standard high. The patient deserves nothing but our best</span>.

### <span class="highlight-rgt">T</span> - Take Time for Every Person

People come from all walks of life and carry with them unique backgrounds, personalities, philosophies, perspectives, and opinions. They stand as products of the infinite number of combinations that result from genetic diversity, social milieu, environmental influence, and personal choice. **At RMUoHP-PAP, we regard each individual as an equal member of the human family**, <span class="highlight">and therefore strive to serve each with our utmost attention, concern, and diligence</span>.
