Actions are predicated upon values. **Inasmuch as we commit ourselves to values that are in harmony with correct principles, our influence for good is limitless.** Rocky Mountain University of Health Professions (RMUoHP) has [thoughtfully selected core values][rmu-core-values]. The RMUoHP Physician Assistant (PA) Program embraces these values.

## RMUoHP PA Additional Core Values 

In addition to RMUoHP's core values, the RMUoHP PA Program espouses those values listed below. **Our commitment is to provide the best education possible for our students. To achieve this, we strive to think, make decisions, and act in accordance with these core values**. As a natural extension, **we strongly emphasize their importance and encourage their adoption to every student** we have the privilege of teaching and mentoring. **As anchors, these values serve as the pillars upon which all else in the Program stands**. The acronym **R.I.G.H.T.** helps us easily remember and communicate these values:

### <span class="highlight-rgt">R</span> - Relationships Come First

Nothing is more important than our relationships with others. **People are more important than things**. It is _people_ who give care, and _people_ who receive care. Furthermore, people come from all walks of life and carry with them unique backgrounds, personalities, philosophies, perspectives, and opinions. They stand as products of the infinite number of combinations that result from genetic diversity, social milieu, environmental influence, and personal choice. At RMUoHP PA, **we regard each individual as an equal member of the human family**, and therefore strive to serve each with our utmost attention, concern, and diligence. At RMUoHP PA, people come first.

### <span class="highlight-ih">I</span> - Innovative Culture

We are living in the midst of dramatic change. Not only is the medical industry changing quickly, but the educational arena as well. We strongly value supporting and sustaining a culture of innovation because as a result, our students and faculty are empowered to act as forward-thinking creatives,  bringing unique and dynamic perspectives in their contributions to addressing the most challenging of problems.

### <span class="highlight-rgt">G</span> - Growth Mindset

A fixed mindset clings to notions of innate ability and capacity, or lack thereof. By contrast, a growth mindset engenders the learning and progress born when persevering through challenge and failure. We are not completed works of varying perfection or imperfection, but products of ongoing experiential and reflective states of being. As such, our best days are inherently ahead of us.

### <span class="highlight-ih">H</span> - High Expectations

Yes, we are here to serve students. But more importantly, we are here to serve the patients whom our students will serve. **Without high expectations, we risk compromising the education of our students, and thus ultimately the care of their patients**. RMUoHP PA holds the standard high. The patient deserves nothing but our best.

### <span class="highlight-rgt">T</span> - Think About the Patient

The medical world is remarkably complex. So many dynamics, so many considerations. **Unfortunately, in the midst of the chaos, thinking about and doing what's best for the patient can slip to the back burner**. At RMUoHP PA, we keep the patient front and center. **The patient comes first, always**.
