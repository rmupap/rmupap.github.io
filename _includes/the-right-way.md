Actions are predicated upon values. Inasmuch as our values are in harmony with correct principles, our influence for good is limitless. We have embraced the following as our core values and principles. They stand as the pillars upon which all else is built. 

As RMUoHP-PAP team members, we strive to think, make decisions, and act in harmony with these fundamental principles and values. As well, we strongly emphasize their importance and encourage their adoption, to every student who we have the privilege of teaching and mentoring. 

## Relationships Come First
