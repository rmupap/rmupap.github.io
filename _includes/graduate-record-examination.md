The [Graduate Record Examination][gre] ([GRE][gre]) is required for all applicants. **We strongly encourage applicants to take the GRE by late September** to ensure that the official scores are received by [CASPA][caspa] by the **November 1st deadline** (or **by late July** for those aiming **for the early consideration deadline of September 1st**). 

All test scores are sent directly to [CASPA][caspa] by the Educational Testing Service (ETS). Reapplicants will be required to request that ETS send official scores for each subsequent future application. 

To be considered for an interview, **an aggregate score of at least 294 is required for the Verbal Reasoning and Quantitative Reasoning subsections**. Additionally, **an Analytical Writing score of at least 3.0 is required**. For more detailed information about each subsection, please refer to the [GRE Test Content and Structure web page by clicking here][gre-structure].
