To be considered for an interview, **all materials must be received and VERIFIED by CASPA no later than November 1st**. The following language from CASPA's website is informative:

> ...To ensure the application is verified on time, applications must be completed (e-submitted, payment received, transcripts received, and two letters of recommendation received) at least four weeks in advance of the deadline date.
