To be considered for an interview, **all** materials must be received **and VERIFIED** by [CASPA]({{site.caspa}}) **no later than November 1st**. The following language from CASPA's website is informative:

> ...To ensure the application is verified on time, applications must be completed (e-submitted, payment received, transcripts received, and two letters of recommendation received) at least four weeks in advance of the deadline date.

In other words, ensure that all of your materials have been submitted around October 1st if you want to ensure your application will be scored.
