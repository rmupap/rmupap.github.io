## Application Information

RMUoHP-PAP will utilize the Central Application Service for Physician Assistants (CASPA) for its application process. The next CASPA cycle will launch April 16, 2014. However, because we are a developing program, applicants will not be able to submit information to apply for our program until April 21st, 2014. 

Please refer to the following web pages for detailed information regarding prerequisite courses, application requirements, application analysis, interview process, candidate selection, and post-acceptance requirements.

## Program Information

RMUPAP will educate outstanding physician assistant clinicians, equipped to handle the challenges of practicing medicine in a multifaceted and complex health care system. Our program will emphasize a holistic patient-centered care approach, educating students not only in the foundational domains of medical knowledge and patient care, but also to think critically, solve complex medical problems, adeptly leverage technology resources to make evidence-based decisions at the point-of-care, and communicate effectively with clinician colleagues, other healthcare professionals, and patients of diverse backgrounds. 

## Specific Program Highlights

### Active and Collaborative Learning  

>"Lecture is only one tool among many. The research shows that when students actively learn, they retain more. We will use all kinds of techniques in the classroom. The more creative, the better."
>
>~ [David Payne PA-C][dP], RMUPAP Program Director

A variety of innovative pedagogical approaches will be employed beyond standard lecture, including case-based, problem-based, and team-based learning. Early in the didactic phase students will be introduced to working through clinical cases as members on a healthcare team. Emphasis will be placed on critical thinking, problem-solving, applying information mined from evidence-based resources, and developing interpersonal and communication skills. 

### Progressive Experiential Design  

>"Medicine today is all about problem-solving. The cup of medical knowledge is far greater than any one person could consume in a lifetime. Having a strong foundation of medical knowledge as a base, and then having the ability to solve problems through a network of colleagues and by quickly accessing, interpreting, and applying high-quality evidence-based information at the point-of-care, will be of far greater value than attempting to memorize an infinite number of details about disease diagnosis and management."
>
>~ [David Payne PA-C][dP], RMUPAP Program Director

Beginning early in the didactic phase, students will be challenged to work through simulated clinical experiences with standardized patients (actors trained to portray specific patient presentations). These experiences will include presenting cases orally to faculty members simulating supervising practitioners and developing comprehensive notes, to include detailed assessments and management plans. A semester of full-time clinical rotations will also break up the didactic phase of the program, enabling students to learn subsequent didactic material with a newly formed clinical perspective.

### Integrated Medical Curricula

The didactic medical curricula is comprised of _synthesized medicine modules_. Instead of courses addressing content separately in clinical medicine, diagnostic skills, and pharmacotherapeutics courses, these components will be integrated into specialty-based module courses (e.g. Cardiovascular, Pulmonology, Pediatrics). This provides an empowering information framework for students, thereby optimizing study effectiveness and improving retention of learned material.

### Self-Reflective Practice Portfolio

Rather than traditional research papers for their capstone project, students will develop _self-reflective practice portfolios_. Throughout the didactic phase of the program, students will be challenged to reflect deeply on their knowledge and skill base. They will identify and quantify their strengths and weaknesses, and then be responsible for developing specific plans to address their weaknesses. During the final two semesters, they will put their plans into action and self-monitor their progress. This project will help prepare well-rounded graduates who have cultivated a consistent pattern of self-reflective practice, a skill crucial for optimal performance within a practice climate of rapid knowledge advancement.

If you have not done so already, feel free to schedule a brief phone appointment with the **Admissions Office (801.375.5125)**, so any remaining questions you have about the program can be addressed.

Thanks!

## Additional Details Regarding Accreditation

The purpose of accreditation is to establish and maintain standards of quality. The [Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (ARC-PA)][arc] is the agency authorized to accredit PA Educational Programs in the United States.

Rocky Mountain University of Health Professions PA Program (RMUPAP) is not accredited at this time, but has entered the process to receive accreditation.

A formal application for _Accreditation - Provisional_ will be submitted to the ARC-PA in September 2014. A formal site visit will be conducted shortly thereafter in November 2014. Members of the ARC-PA commision will convene in March of 2015 to render a decision on RMUPAP's accreditation status, prior to anticipated matriculation of the inaugural RMUPAP class in June 2015.

The ARC-PA describes the provisional accreditation process as follows:

> Accreditation - Provisional is an accreditation status granted when the plans and resource allocation, if fully implemented as planned, of a proposed program that has not yet enrolled students appear to demonstrate the programâ€™s ability to meet the [ARC-PA Standards][standards] or when a program holding accreditation-provisional status appears to demonstrate continued progress in complying with the Standards as it prepares for the graduation of the first class (cohort) of students.
> 
> The provisional accreditation process begins with a thorough review of the planning, organization, and proposed content of a program that is in the advanced planning stages, but not yet operational. The provisional accreditation pathway is the only entry way for proposed new programs into the accreditation process.
